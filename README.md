# Explore Time Delay Interferometry 

This repository provides the simulation of six scientific measurements of a static constellation of *TAIJI*,  the TDI-1 computation, the TDI-Infinity computation, the APCI computation and the corresponding sensitivity curves.

- **Simulation** ([Baghi](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.122001 ))

  Three *TAIJI* satellites rotates around the Sun, and they form an equilateral triangle whose centre follows a heliocentric circular orbit, such that its position at any time *t* is given by

- **TDI-1.0**

  X, A, E, T; requiring the light travel time between two satellites

- **TDI-Infinity** ([Vallisneri](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12343 ))

  The null space of the design matrix; requiring the light travel time between two satellites

- **APCI** ([Baghi](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.104.122001 ))

  The principal component of the Toeplitz matrix of the science measurements. Of course, SVD and PCA are the same from a mathematical point of view. Additionally, PCA for TDI gives us a hint that we can handle TDI from a probability perspective. When it comes to the missing data case, three possible solutions are given: **imputation, alternative and considering**. 

  PPCA with EM algorithm may be promising; weight PCA is also worthy to try.

- **Sensitivity** ([Wang](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.063021))

  Ok~ The equation used to compute the sensitivity curve is from WANGPANPAN(2020). **HOWEVER**, equations in the paper are inconsistent . üòÖ(HUST ~LoL~) Would try to compute the sensitivity curves from simulation.
